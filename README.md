# BMW_CAN_iDrive

This is the code and such for my BMW iDrive (2008 / E60 / version 1) DIY.

See https://javalins.wordpress.com/2022/01/11/bmw-idrive-controller-diy/ and https://javalins.wordpress.com/2022/02/23/bmw-idrive-controller-diy-part-2/

Put the can-bus-idrive-test-feb-v2.ino file in its folder and run with Ardiuno (works with a Teensy 3.2) as normal.

Put the rest of the files in a library folder called "JB_MCP_CAN"

Breakout board available for the low speed CAN using the surface mount TJA1054 transceiver -> https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ek6TIOAX

Enjoy.
